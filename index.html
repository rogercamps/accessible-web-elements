        <h2>How this all got started</h2>
        <p>
          We wear a lot of hats as front-end developers. Depending on the client or company you work for, you may be the designer, UX/UI specialist, site-builder, QA tester, and developer all rolled into one. How can we possibly add the accessibility hat on top of all that? What accessible pieces should we even include? Which pieces are easy wins vs. impossible juggernauts? How do we implement inclusive design and development when a project does not have a lot of time or budget to include that piece?
          <br>
          <br>
          One way we can tackle these issues is by using an accessible component driven approach. By thinking about inclusiveness from the start, we can get a head start on accessibility while still building the required site components.

        <p>
          Maybe you are a total beginner and wondering where to start? That's cool too...welcome! Learning accessibility can feel a bit like drinking out of a firehose, so here are some tips to follow on your journey toward accessibility:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tip #1: Don’t Freak Out. There is a ton of information out there about website accessibility. No one expects you to know everything about everything. It’s ok to say you don’t know something. Which brings me to my next rule…</li>
          <li>Tip #2: Learn a Few Things. Read an article, watch a video, attend a webinar, chat with someone on twitter. If you focus on one aspect of accessibility at a time, you will not get overwhelmed and you will retain the information better.</li>
          <li>Tip #3: Build from the Ground Up. If you have the opportunity, build accessibility into the beginning of a project. It will be more difficult, more timely and thus more expensive to retrofit your site for accessibility after the site is complete.</li>
          <li>Tip #4: Use the Right Tools. There are lots of accessibility tools that wonderful people spent lots of time creating, so use them. Use tools during the build process (ex. using Color Safe to check color combos) and after the site is finished (ex. using WAVE to evaluate accessibility errors and alerts, etc)</li>
          <li>Tip #5: Try, Try Again. Keep in mind that even adding one or two accessible pieces to a website is moving in the right direction. The next site might have four or five pieces. "Rome wasn’t built in a day" and neither are accessible websites.</li>
        </ul>
          <div class="line-separator"></div>
          <div class="line-separator"></div>
          <h1><a name="forms"></a>Forms</h1>
            <div class="line-separator"></div>
          <h2><a name="checkboxes"></a>Checkboxes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> surrounds the entire grouping of checkboxes or radio buttons. The <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> provides a description for the grouping.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some assistive technology reads the legend text for each fieldset, so it should be brief and descriptive. This helps someone using assistive technology to understand the question they are answering with the group of checkboxes.
            </li>
            <li>
              WAI-ARIA provides a grouping role that functions similarly to <code>fieldset</code> and <code>legend</code>. In option #2 the <code>div</code> element has <code>role=group</code> to indicate that the contained elements are members of a group and the <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute references the id for text that will serve as the label for the group. Note: This method is not supported by all browser/AT devices.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            The <code>&lt;span class="visuallyhidden"&gt;</code> content in the second example is not necessary information to choose an option. It is important to point out that in some cases, it is very useful to add additional information. However, in this case, it is meant as a joke for people using screen-readers. And why not have a joke visible only to people using screen-readers? How many times do we hide content from them?
